	<li>What does 8cookies actually do?</li>
	<p>We give you the option to save your cookies and tabs to the cloud.</p>
	<li>But what does that mean?</li>
	<p>It means you can start browsing on your laptop, then move to your desktop, then move to another desktop and you'd always have the same windows & tabs open. You'll also be logged in to all the sites you're usually logged in to on your primary computer </p>
	<li>How do I sign up?</li>
	<p>Just ask for an invite!</p>
	<li>Wait, so who can access my data?</li>
	<p>No one except you. We couldn't access your data even if we wanted to</p>
	<li>What does 'port current profile to cloud' mean?</li>
	<p>It's basically asking you if you want to send the current information in your browser to the cloud. You would probably want to click this if you're signing up from your own computer, otherwise you would just start a clean session. But don't worry about this too much you can do this later using the merge button</p>
	<li>What does the merge button do?</li>
	<p>It merges all the cookies and tabs you currently have open, with your profile on the cloud. If you want to login to 8cookies but don't want to lose the tabs that are open at the moment, just click the merge button. The tabs in the cloud will open and current opened tabs won't close</p>
	<li>What else can 8cookies do?</li>
	<p>It can save open windows so you can return to them later. You do this by clicking the 'save state' button. When you want to see the saved states, just click the 'show save states' button</p>
	<li>Which browsers do you support?</li>
	<p>Only Chrome at the moment</p>
	<li>I have some suggestions!</li>
	<p>Great, we love suggestions. Hit the feedback button</p>
	<li>I want to leave 8cookies</li>
	<p>Ok, we don't like when people leave but we do give you the choice. Right click the extensions's icon, options and then click the 'delete' button next to my data from the server</p>
	<li>Something weird happened</li>
	<p>We don't expect anything weird to happen. But if it does no need to worry. 8cookies created a restore point when you installed the extension. You could go back to that restore point by going to options and clicking 'go' next to go to restore point.</p>
