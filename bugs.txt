sending to server data that is not in a json format will cause an error (not null though)

if server is down - receive data will still interpret it as a valid response!! 
when network is down, this is not considered an error for jquery! weird! I know

if a user is logged in two different computers -> new login doesn't update old login

session in gmail => login => logout => close browser => open => gmail session is gone
